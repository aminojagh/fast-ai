Many Hugging Face libraries (along with other libraries such as scikit-learn) use the concept of a \"pipeline\" to indicate a sequence of steps that when combined complete some task. We'll look at the individual steps of the pipeline later -- for now though, let's just use it to see what it can do.\n",

We indicate that we want to use the `fp16` (half-precision) version of the weights, and we tell `diffusers` to expect the weights in that format. This allows us to perform much faster inference with almost no discernible difference in quality.\n",
