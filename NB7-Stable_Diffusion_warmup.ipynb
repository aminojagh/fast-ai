Many Hugging Face libraries (along with other libraries such as scikit-learn) use the concept of a \"pipeline\" to indicate a sequence of steps that when combined complete some task.

We indicate that we want to use the `fp16` (half-precision) version of the weights, and we tell `diffusers` to expect the weights in that format. This allows us to perform much faster inference with almost no discernible difference in quality.\n",

        "[Dreambooth](https://dreambooth.github.io) is a kind of fine-tuning that attempts to introduce new subjects by providing just a few images of the new subject. The goal is similar to that of [Textual Inversion](#Textual-Inversion), but the process is different. Instead of creating a new token as Textual Inversion does, we select an existing token in the vocabulary (usually a rarely used one), and fine-tune the model for a few hundred steps to bring that token close to the images we provide. This is a regular fine-tuning process in which all modules are unfrozen.\n",
        "For example, we fine-tuned a model with a prompt like `\"photo of a sks person\"`, using the rare `sks` token to qualify the term `person`, and using photos of Jeremy as the targets. Let's see how it works."

In some situations we observe problems such as catastrophic forgetting of the associated term (`\"person\"` in this case). The authors applied a technique called \"prior preservation\" to try to avoid it by performing a special regularization using other examples of the term, in addition to the ones we provided. The cool thing about this idea is that those examples can be easily generated by the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model itself! We did not use that method in the model we trained for the previous example."
